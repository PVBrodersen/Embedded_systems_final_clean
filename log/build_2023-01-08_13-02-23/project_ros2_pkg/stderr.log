CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findbram_uio.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "bram_uio",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "bram_uio" with any
  of the following names:

    bram_uioConfig.cmake
    bram_uio-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "bram_uio" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "bram_uio_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "bram_uio" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
